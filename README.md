# Titanic_prediction
## Project Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. The model analyzes features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare to determine survival likelihood.

## Objectives
- Preprocess Titanic passenger data
- Build classification models to predict survival
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Generate predictions for test data

## Dataset
The dataset comes from [Kaggle's Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and includes:
- `train.csv` - Labeled training data (891 passengers)
- `test.csv` - Unlabeled test data (418 passengers)

## Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
